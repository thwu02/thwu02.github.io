Gliding across the sidewalk,  
I trail behind myself—  
Scanning the sea of faces,  
And finding a familiar sight.  
As morning gives way,  
Laughter and smiles exchanged,  
I shrink.  
A stroll by the lake—  
Scored by the symphony of the city,  
Imbued with elation,  
Hiding from the midday warmth.  
Settle into a comfortable rhythm—  
Watching us move in synchrony,  
Under the evening light,  
As I grow larger than life.  
But then goodbyes are swapped,  
While twilight falls,  
And I blend  
Into the shadows of night—  
Drifting away  
Until light returns
