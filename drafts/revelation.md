We reach an understanding  
By concealing ourselves  
When we could have  
Worn our hearts on our sleeves.  
Acted the same,  
But free from evasion,  
Of our deep desires.  
If only we had,  
A safe place to confess.  
To securely hold on  
To things now self-evident,  
And arrange our affections.
