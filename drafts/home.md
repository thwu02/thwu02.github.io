A place to wipe my feet,  
And a place to hang my hat.  
A place to store my shoes,  
And a place to hang my coat.  

A room with a bed,  
And a nightstand to match.  
A mirror leaning in the corner,  
And a chair draped with clothes.  

A stack of dusty books,  
And an empty bookcase  
A desk piled high,  
And a drafty window  

An unused stove,  
And an empty fridge.  
A leaky faucet,  
And an unwashed pan.
