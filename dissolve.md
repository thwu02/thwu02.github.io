Moonlight scattered, mixing  
With the glow of streetlights.  
Silence of night, muffled  
By the cacophony of the heart  
Warmth of joy, encouraged  
By the cool darkness  
No words exchanged,  
Nothing left unsaid  
Strolling into a mosaic of memory, content  
To be suspended in nostalgic fog, unable  
Dissolving  
through mist to reality
